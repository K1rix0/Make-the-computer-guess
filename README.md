# Make-the-computer-guess
Input a number and the computer itself will try and guess it (it won't cheat)
The computer will have 8 gueses to guess the number inputted by the user, and this is achieved by reducing the width of min and max by assigning the number chosen by the computer right before respectively, and therefore gives the computer a better chance each time to get the number right like us (the humans).
The starting min is 0 and the max is 100, and as i said will shorten every round given.

As I forgot to say aswell, this was inspired by the beginner projects video from freeCodeCamp.org on youtube

As for the guesses given, 8 would be the default, and same with the min and max(0, 100), you can modify the numbers to your liking as i thought that these numbers would best qualify a "fair and interesting game"
